      <p>
        This is an ultra basic app that uses vanilla Node — no Express.js — to
        return an HTML file.
      </p>
      <p>
        The HTML file also makes requests for CSS and JS files, so the Node
        server has to handle those too.
      </p>
      <p>
        It checks for the request's extension first. If it includes ".css", it
        returns the only stylesheet available — "style.css".
      </p>
      <p>It does the exact same thing for JavaScript.</p>
      <p>This feels highly inefficient, but it's a start.</p>
      <p>
        I highly doubt I will update this page again, so if you stumble upon it
        — hello! Node is cool!
